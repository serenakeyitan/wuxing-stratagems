# Wuxing-Stratagems Game Rules

## Elemental Factions
Players choose from five factions, each representing an element:
- **Red (Fire)**
- **Blue (Water)**
- **Green (Wood)**
- **Yellow (Earth)**
- **Purple (Metal)**

## Generating Cycle
- In the generating cycle, certain elements support each other.
- When a cell is next to a cell in its generating cycle, the supporting cell **loses 1 life**, and the supported cell **gains 1 life**.
- **Example**: If a Wood (Green) cell is next to a Fire (Red) cell, the Wood cell loses 1 life, and the Fire cell gains 1 life.

## Overcoming Cycle
- In the overcoming cycle, certain elements overcome or weaken each other.
- When a cell is next to a cell in its overcoming cycle, the overcoming cell **gains 1 life**, and the overcome cell **loses 1 life**.
- **Example**: If a Wood (Green) cell is next to an Earth (Yellow) cell, the Wood cell gains 1 life, and the Earth cell loses 1 life.

## Base Rule for Same Faction (commented out for now)
- Cells gain life when adjacent to cells of the same faction.
- For each neighboring cell of the same faction, a cell **gains 1 life**.

## Conflict Resolution
- When two players place their cells on the same grid in the same round, a conflict occurs, and the grid becomes **'Evil'** (marked in light grey).
- 'Evil' cells have their own set of behaviors and rules.

## Gameplay
- Players take turns placing cells on a 10x10 grid.
- Each cell starts with a certain amount of life.
- The game evolves as players commit their actions, with cells gaining or losing life based on their elemental interactions and neighboring cells.

## Objective
- The objective is to strategically place cells to sustain life and grow your faction, taking advantage of elemental interactions.
